# Random Weather Generator

## Description

A random weather data generator written in Python. This program uses the Google Maps API to obtain geopositioning and elevation data for a customised list of locations, as well as the Dark Sky API to obtain historical weather measurements for those locations (e.g. max/min temperature, humidity, pressure). Using these datasets, the generator will create realistic aritifical weather observations in a standard format, and output those observations in a comma-separated values (CSV) file. The data will be output in the following format:

Location  | Position         | Local Time          | Conditions | Temperature | Pressure | Humidity
--------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | -----------:| --------:| --------:
Sydney    | -33.86,151.21,39 | 2015-12-23 16:02:12 | Rain       |       +12.5 |   1010.3 | 97
Melbourne | -37.83,144.98,7  | 2015-12-25 02:30:55 | Snow       |        -5.3 |    998.4 | 55
Adelaide  | -34.92,138.62,48 | 2016-01-04 23:05:37 | Sunny      |       +39.4 |   1114.1 | 12

where

 - Location is an optional label describing one or more positions
 - Position is a comma-separated triple containing latitude, longitude, and
   elevation in metres above sea level
 - Local time is an ISO8601 datetime
 - Conditions are either 'Snow', 'Rain', or 'Sunny'
 - Temperature is in Â°C
 - Pressure is in hPa
 - Relative humidity is a %

## Build instructions

In order to install the required dependencies and libraries to run the weather generator, your system should have the following prerequisites satisfied:
1. Windows, macOS, and Linux are all supported - however, if you are running Windows you will have to install a Linux filesystem (e.g. Cygwin) to run the Makefile commands.
1. Python 2.7.12 or greater installed with all standard libraries.
1. Permissions to download and install packages from PyPi via `pip`.

To build the application and download the required Python dependencies, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository to your machine/server.
2. `cd` to the project folder **weather-generator** and execture the `make build` command. This will download and install all the required dependencies.

## Running a simulation

In order to generate a set of random weather observations, follow the steps below:
1. Execute `make run obs=<obs>` in the main project directory, where the `<obs>` argument is the number of data points you would like to generate in the dataset (e.g. `make run obs=1000`).
2. After running this command, a CSV file named _generated_weather_data.csv_, containing the randomly generated weather observations, will be written to the _output_ folder.

**Note:** Any existing datasets in this folder will be overwritten via the make run command.

## Build and run using Docker

If you have Docker installed, you can build and run a Docker image using docker-compose to generate your random weather observations. To generate a dataset using Docker, follow the steps below:
1. Execute `make rundocker obs=<obs>` in the project directory. This command will build a local Docker image with the project dependencies, run the container and pass the `<obs>` variable to the container as the number of observations to generate.
2. As with running the simulation on your local machine, the Docker container will write the output CSV with the random weather observations to the _output_ folder.

**Note**: If you are using macOS, you must configure Docker to allow the directory in which the project folder is in to be bind mounted into Docker containers. You can set this through the "File Sharing" pane in the Docker for Mac settings. For example, if you cloned the repo into the `/Users/Projects` directory, then you could add `/Users` or `/Users/Projects` as mount points.
